# Sci-Cream

A collection of resources about the science and technology of ice cream and related frozen products.
Namely, this repo contains the [`sci-cream` Rust crate](#sci-cream-crate), a library to facilitate
the mathematical analysis of ice cream mixes and their properties, as well as the
[`sci-cream` app](#sci-cream-app), a web app that provides user-friendly utilities to facilitate the
development and study of ice cream recipes. There is also
[documentation](https://github.com/ramonrsv/sci-cream/tree/main/docs) about ice cream science, and
an [ingredient database](https://github.com/ramonrsv/sci-cream/tree/main/data/ingredients) that can
be imported with the library.

The [`sci-cream` app](https://github.com/ramonrsv/sci-cream/tree/main/packages/app) is a web app
that utilizes the [`sci-cream` crate](#sci-cream-crate) to provide user-friendly utilities, most
notably an ice cream calculator, to facilitate the development and study of ice cream recipes.
