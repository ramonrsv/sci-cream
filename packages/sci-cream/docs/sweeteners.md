### Sweetness Values

There aren't yet any chemical tests to measure the sweetness of chemicals, so we must rely on
subjective assessments of sweetness. I have not been able to find any original research attempting
to quantity the sweetness of various sugars and glucose syrup products. The best sources that I have
been able to find are tables in _Ice Cream 7th Edition_ (Goff & Hartel, 2013, Table 3.4, p. 67)[^2]
and _Glucose Syrups: Technology and Applications_ (Hull, 2010, Appendix C.3, p. 323)[^15], which do
not reference any original research. The values between these two texts roughly match each other,
but there are various issues.

The sweetness values grow linearly with DE (Dextrose Equivalence) values, but they are seemingly not
affected by the ratio of total solids in these products. This would make sense if the stated values
were for the dry solids, but Goff & Hartel explicitly states that they are "relative to sucrose on
an _as is or product basis_". The values are also greater than the sum of their sugar spectra (i.e.
dextrose, maltose, maltotriose, and higher sugars content) (Hull, 2010, Appendix C.1, p. 321) for
even the highest cited sweetness values of the individual sugars. Synergistic reactions between
components have been used to explain the effect. ("The Sweetness of Glucose Syrup", 2025)[^16].

If these values are taken to be in an "as is or product basis", then they are also significantly
inconsistent with values in various modern manufacturer, seller, and software sources. ("The
Sweetness of Glucose Syrup", 2025)[^16], [Gateway Food Products co., Du-Bake 42/43 Glucose
Syrup](https://www.gatewayfoodproducts.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/GFP_CornSyrups_DuBake.pdf),
[Owl Software, Relative Sweetness Values of Various
Sweeteners](https://owlsoft.com/pdf_docs/WhitePaper/Rel_Sweet.pdf), [Modernist Pantry, Glucose DE 42
Powder](https://modernistpantry.com/products/glucose-de-42-powder.html). If taken to be for dry
solids, then they are a bit more consistent, and the linear progression relative to DE values in
_Glucose Syrups_ (Hull, 2010, Appendix C.3, p. 323)[^15] makes more sense.

It is worth noting that sweetness values can sometimes vary widely between sources, e.g. the
sweetness of maltose relative to sucrose has been cited as 32 (Goff & Hartel, 2013, Table 3.4,
p. 67)[^2], 35 (Spillane, 2006, p. 253)[^9], 50 (Hull, 2010, Appendix C.3, p. 323)[^15], 75 ("The
Sweetness of Glucose Syrup", 2025)[^16], etc., and they can even vary based on concentrations
(Belitz, 2009)[^16]. As such, there may be strong limitations on the ability to source accurate and
consistent sweetness values for various sweeteners.

Within this library, and with regards to maltodextrin, glucose syrup, high maltose syrup, and
high-fructose glucose syrup, the sweetness values will be sources from _Glucose Syrups: Technology
and Applications_ (Hull, 2010, Appendix C.3, p. 323)[^15] assumed to be for the dry solids, whilst
the solids contents of each product will be cited as 80% for glucose and high maltose syrups, 77%
for high-fructose glucose syrup, and 95% for maltodextrin. (Goff & Hartel, 2013, Table 3.4,
p.67)[^2]. Glucose _powder_ will be cited with the same values for dry solids, with 95% solids.
