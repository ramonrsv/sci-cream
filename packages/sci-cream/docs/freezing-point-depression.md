# Freezing Point Depression

Freezing Point Depression (FPD) refers to the property of ingredients that lowers the freezing point
of water in an ice cream mix, a crucial factor that affects the texture of ice cream once frozen.
Ingredients, such as sucrose (table sugar), fully dissolve in water and create a homogeneous
mixture. The freezing point of this solution is lower than that of pure water. How much lower
depends on the solute and the amount. Common ingredients that contribute to this effect are sugars
(including artificial sweeteners), alcohol, and salts (including those found in milk solids).

## PAC, AFP, FPDF, SE

Potere Anti-Congelante (PAC), Anti-Freeze Power (AFP), Freezing Point Depression Factor (FPDF), and
Sucrose Equivalence (SE), are all related terms, usually expressed as a percentage, per mille,
multiplicative factor, or g/100g of total mix by weight, that indicate an ingredient or set of
ingredients' ability to depress the freezing point of water, relative to sucrose's ability.

The are confusing conventions regarding what each term entails, e.g. whether the effect of salts
from milk solids is taken into account, and there are conflicting sources regarding the details of
calculations, e.g. some sources describe 100g of sucrose in 1000g of water (9.1% sucrose in mix, as
opposed to the expected 10%) as having a PAC of 100. However, from a user's perspective the details
are somewhat irrelevant since usually the purpose of these terms is to facilitate comparison between
ice cream recipes, which only requires that the methods be consistent.

This app and documentation uses the terms to reference two related concepts:

1. A factor describing an ingredient's freezing point depression power relative to sucrose. For
   example, sucrose (the reference) has a PAC/AFP of 100, and FPDF of 1. Fructose, with about 1.9
   times the freezing point depression power of sucrose, has a PAC/AFP of 190, and FPDF of 1.9.
2. A dimensionless quantity, usually as g/100g of total mix, describing the freezing point
   depression effect of an ingredient or set of ingredients' concentration in a mix as a sucrose
   equivalence. For example, 100g of sucrose in 1000g of mix has a PAC of 100 and SE of 10.
   Similarly, 100g of fructose in 1000g of mix has a PAC of 190 and SE of 19.

Note that, regarding (2), the equivalence is only with respect to freezing point depression power,
and not actually equivalent to substituting those ingredients, as doing so would alter the total
amount of mix and the respective proportions of solids and water.

## Absolute PAC

PAC and SE, regarding concept (2) above, are useful to determine ingredients' contribution to
freezing point depression. However, by themselves they are not very good at determining the freezing
point depression of a mix, since they do not take into account the proportion of water that needs to
be controlled. The equivalent concentration of sucrose in water corresponds more closely to the
actual observed freezing point depression. The term Absolute PAC (Abs. PAC, APAC), coined by
Underbelly (Raphaelson, 2023, Appendix 3)[^1], represents this ratio, and is calculated as PAC
divided by total water. Indeed, SE/water (g/100g of water) is used in the Goff-Hartel method (Goff &
Hartel, 2013, p. 181)[^2] for calculating a FPD Curve, looking up from an empirical table of
freezing point depression of sucrose solutions (Goff & Hartel, 2013, Table 6.1, p. 182)[^2].
