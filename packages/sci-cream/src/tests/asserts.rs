//! Module to re-export commonly used assertion macros so that they can be uniformly imported by
//! tests as `use crate::tests::asserts::*;`, and so that dependencies can be better managed.
//!
//! Test modules should `use crate::tests::asserts::*;`, to glob import all assertions macros. If
//! there are "'assert_eq/ne' is ambiguous" errors, they should also add
//! `use shadow_asserts::{assert_eq, assert_ne};` to shadow the prelude's `assert_eq/ne` macros.

// @todo Investigating using `all_asserts::{assert_range, assert_nrange}` for range checks.
#[allow(unused_imports)] // @todo Remove when used.

/// These `assert_eq` and `assert_ne` re-exports are actually never used, since glob imports are not
/// allowed to shadow imports in the prelude. However, they trigger an error that "'assert_eq/ne' is
/// ambiguous, which forces the user to `use shadow_asserts::{assert_eq, assert_ne};` and therefore
/// prevents silently using the wrong `assert_eq` and `assert_ne` macros from the prelude.
// @todo: Consider using `pretty_assertions::assert_matches!` macro when it stabilizes.
